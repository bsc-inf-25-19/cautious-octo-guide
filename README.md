## Spotify Playlister

Alright buddy, this is your project to make life easier by transferring the huge amount of track files of your local MP3 files have accumulated all the way to Spotify. Here's the plan:

### Objective:
- Get the track lists from your MP3 files and create playlists from them using the metadata supposedly in their tags.

### How will i Do It:
- **Python Magic:** Use of Python scripts to read the metadata from the MP3 files.
- **API Integration:** Interacting with Spotify's Web API to search for local tracks and create spotify playlists and populate my library.

### Why This is Rad:
- I’ll finally have my local music collection on Spotify without manually creating playlists and liking songs .
- It’s a great way to practice Python and API integration skills.
- Practice letting go, pang'onopang'ono
